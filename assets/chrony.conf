# This directive tells 'chronyd' to parse the 'adjtime' file to find out if the
# real-time clock keeps local time or UTC. It overrides the 'rtconutc' directive.
hwclockfile /etc/adjtime

# This directive enables kernel synchronisation (every 11 minutes) of the
# real-time clock. Note that it canâ€™t be used along with the 'rtcfile' directive.

# Step the system clock instead of slewing it if the adjustment is larger than
# one second, but only in the first three clock updates.

# Unfortunately, chronyd places the pid file into the same directory as the command socket.
# It writes the pid as root before dropping to the chrony user.  The command socket 
# directory must be owned by chrony or chrond will abort.  But, chronyd will not create a
# pid file in that directory without the powerful linux capability dac_override which otherwise
# would not be needed.  If you want to run this without that capability you can enable this to
# set the pid file to null. A pid file is not needed by this container.
